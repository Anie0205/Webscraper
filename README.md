# Web Scraper with BeautifulSoup

This is a Python-based web scraper utilizing BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and data extraction.

## Example Usage (example.py)

The `example.py` file serves as a learning resource to understand how to build a web scraper using BeautifulSoup. The code in `example.py` was adapted from the tutorial at [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/02/build-web-scraper-python-5-minutes.html). It demonstrates scraping data from the [Quotes to Scrape](https://quotes.toscrape.com/) website.

This example showcases how the scraper can extract data from a specific website and can serve as a starting point for your scraping projects.

## My Blog Scraper (my_blog_scraped.py)
